When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	I would want to use a remote repository instead of keeping all my work local when I want to share my project with another persons, so they can use my project and maybe improve it.
	I also would want to use a remote repository to save my project in the cloud and if I lose it in my computer, I will still have the online repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because the remote version could change something that I don't want in my local version. For example I have a clone of a project in some version of it and the author added or modified the project to a new version that doesn't fix on the purposes that I have. So I'd rathe to choose when I pull this changes to my local version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are copies of repositories that GitHub create in the GitHub itself. I can clone a fork and all the forks point out to the original repository. The clones are copies that I make of a repository into my local computer. Branches are subdivisions of my repository that I can work on without messing up with the master or another branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	If there is no internet I can see if there were changes or not and work normally.
