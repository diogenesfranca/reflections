When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	I would want to use a remote repository instead of keeping all my work local when I want to share my project with another persons, so they can use my project and maybe improve it.
	I also would want to use a remote repository to save my project in the cloud and if I lose it in my computer, I will still have the online repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because the remote version could change something that I don't want in my local version. For example I have a clone of a project in some version of it and the author added or modified the project to a new version that doesn't fix on the purposes that I have. So I'd rathe to choose when I pull this changes to my local version.
