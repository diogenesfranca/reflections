When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I would want to use a remote repository instead of keeping all my work local when I want to share my project with another persons, so they can use my project and maybe improve it.
  I also would want to use a remote repository to save my project in the cloud and if I lose it in my computer, I will still have the online repository.
