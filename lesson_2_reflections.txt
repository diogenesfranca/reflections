What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When I initialize a repository and run git status it show me the files in that repository, show me that there is not a commit yet and show me that the files are not tracked yet.
	I need to initialize it to create a hidden folder wich will contain metadata of the repository and to choose which files to track and add to commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is where I can place the files that I want to commit to the repository, while the working directory shows me all the files, including that ones that I didn't add to the staging area. The staging area has a good concept because with it I can choose which files I want to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
